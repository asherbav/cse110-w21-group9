# Team 9 - 02/22/21

- Goal
- Members Present: Everyone
- Members Absent:
- Meeting Logistics
  - Start: 6:30 PM
  - End:
- Clarity
  - Goals and requirements were not always clear
  - Some bugs during coding were very confusing
- Autonomy
  - Cleaning up the GitHub made task assignment much simpler
  - Issues and tasks made it easier to work on out own, but still confined to the team consensus for features and designs. (Not a bad thing, but canâ€™t be fully autonomous inherently)
- Mastery
  - We generally worked out most issues in our process
- Meaning
  - Sprint was extremely successful and we were able to overcome big hurdles
- Impact
  - It's just a timer so not too impactful
  - Our project is not likely to impact anyone besides us
- Engagement
  - We had work meetings almost every day
  - Lots of engagement and discussions on Slack
- Start
  - Focussing more on documentation and testing requirements
  - More rigid structure of development and write cleaner code
  - Start earlier on work rather than leave the bulk for the end of the sprint
  - Complete the MVP and add our diagrams to the repo
  - Do more team check-ins
- Stop
  - Filling out when2meet late
  - Having last minute meetings and schedule them earlier
