# Choose a JavaScript Version

## Context and Problem Statement

We want to record which version of JavaScript we decided to use for our Pomodoro web app.

## Considered Options

* ES4
* ES5
* ES6

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: ES6, because

* higher performance
* let and const variables added
* less time-consuming object manipulation
* browsers version support is not a big issue (from 2016)
