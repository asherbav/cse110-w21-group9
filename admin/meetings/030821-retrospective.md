# Team 9 - 03/08/21

- Goal: Sprint Retrospective
- Members Present: Everyone
- Members Absent:
- Meeting Logistics
  - Start: 6:30 PM
  - End: 8:00 PM
- Clarity
  - Goals and requirements were not always clear
  - Some bugs during coding were very confusing
- Autonomy
  - Cleaning up the GitHub made task assignment much simpler
  - Issues and tasks made it easier to work on out own, but still confined to the team consensus for features and designs. (Not a bad thing, but canâ€™t be fully autonomous inherently)
- Mastery
  - We generally worked out most issues in our process
- Meaning
  - Sprint was extremely successful and we were able to overcome big hurdles

  - Lots of engagement and discussions on Slack
