## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: Color scheme 5, because

* enough distinction for both kinds of red-green color blindness
* enough distinction for blue-yellow color blindness
* at the same time, the color scheme still looks appealing in its true form and to color-blind users
* enough contrast to work with
