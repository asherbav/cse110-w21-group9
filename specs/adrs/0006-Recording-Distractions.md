# Choose How the User Should Record Distractions

* Status: Accepted

## Context and Problem Statement

We want to record how the user will log distractions, and to what detail.

## Considered Options

* user can write a distraction description
* user can not write a distraction description (count only)
* log distractions on timer page
* log distractions on task table page

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: User logs distractions on timer page and is unable to provide descriptions, because

* distractions should be logged immediately when they occur
* logging at the task page could result in forgetting what distractions occurred during work
* descriptions would make the table look too busy
* having the user provide descriptions distracts the user from focusing on their own work
