# Choose Coding Conventions/Styles

* Status: Accepted

## Context and Problem Statement

We want to record which what coding conventions to use to maintain uniform and consistent code.

## Considered Options

* camelCase
* PascalCase
* snake_case
* classes for CSS styling
* id's for JS interactions

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: camelCase, classes for CSS styling, and id's for JS, because

* majority of us use camelCase the most
* can use CSS class selector 
* elements in the same class should generally have the same style
* can get element by ID in JS for ease in adding interations with specific elements
