# Choose How to Display Breaks

* Status: Accepted

## Context and Problem Statement

We want to record how the user will see the break/break timer.

## Considered Options

* See break timer on timer page
* See break timer on task page

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: We chose to have the break timer viewed on the task page, because

* allows user to see upcoming tasks and prepare
* gives user more freedom rather than restricting them to view the timer only
* can easily be implemented by placing the break timer in the corner of the task page
* looks fine design wise
