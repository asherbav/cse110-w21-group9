# Choose Length of Break Time

* Status: Accepted

## Context and Problem Statement

We want to record how long each break should last.

## Considered Options

* 3 minute short break
* 5 minute short break
* 15 minute long break
* 30 minute long break
* user can change break time

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: Fixed 5 minute short break and 15 minute long break, because

* 3 minute adheres to pomo technique but feels too short 
* 5 minutes adheres to pomo technique and feels more well rounded
* 30 minutes adheres to technique but seems too long for continous work flow
* 15 minutes adheres to the pomo technique
* it would go against the pomo technique to allow the user to change break times
